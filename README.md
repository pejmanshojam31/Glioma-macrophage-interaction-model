Study Procedure Overview. The study began by generating a comprehensive set of 20,000 parameters using the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) method. These parameters were then incorporated into our mathematical model to simulate infiltration widths following resection, ranging from 3 to 12 months. The resulting data enabled us to create a simulated dataset that closely resembles a cohort of patients. This dataset became the foundation for our subsequent analysis, where machine learning techniques were employed to evaluate the model's predictive capabilities and identify the importance of different features.
