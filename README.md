In this code, we have first developed a spatio-temporal model of the interactions between Glioma cells and Tumor tumor-associated macrophages. Then we used the model as a virtual reality platform for generating a synthetic dataset of 20,000 virtual patients to explore the predictive power of each feature.

We choose five virtual "specimens" that represent either biopsies or sections of the resected tumor at the time of initial diagnosis. From these five simulated "specimens," we then gather data, including the densities of tumor cells and macrophages. Additionally, we randomly select locations that cover the entire spectrum from the tumor core to the resection margin.
